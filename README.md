# GlideRatio (Android) project

GlideRatio is Android application to calculate minimal glide ratio (of a wing) required to fly your line in
Speedflying, Paragliding, Basejumping and other Paralpnisme activities.

It's simple (useful) application with minimalistic UI / UX to use it in your Hike&Fly missions.
